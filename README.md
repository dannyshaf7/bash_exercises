# 🐚 Bash Scripting Exercises: *Black Hat Bash*

Welcome! This repository contains my personal collection of Bash scripting exercises as I work through the book *Black Hat Bash*.

Each script in this repository corresponds to a specific exercise, topic, or technique from the book. The goal is to reinforce my understanding of Bash scripting—especially in the context of security, automation, and Linux system internals.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each file is a standalone Bash script (`.sh`) and is named to reflect the concept or section it represents. Scripts are written to be readable and reusable, with inline comments where helpful.

> Note: File names and numbering may not reflect the actual chapter numbers but follow a consistent logical order for learning.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Core Bash syntax and structure
- Control flow with conditionals and loops
- File and process manipulation
- Scripting for security-related tasks
- CLI tool automation and chaining
- Permissions, I/O redirection, and more

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Bash installed. Most Unix-like systems already do.

```bash
chmod +x scriptname.sh
$ ./scriptname.sh    or   $ bash scriptname.sh

Some scripts may require root privileges or a specific environment to demonstrate their full functionality. Run with caution and only in safe environments (e.g., virtual machines or containers).

🛠️ Requirements
Bash (v4+ recommended)
A Unix-based OS (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)
Optional: virtual environment or sandbox for safe testing

🧪 Disclaimer
These scripts are for educational purposes only. Some examples from Black Hat Bash may involve tools or techniques related to offensive security—use responsibly and legally.
